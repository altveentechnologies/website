      <LegalBody>
        <LegalIntro>
          These Terms of Service (“Terms”) apply when you use the website or
          engage {SITE.legalName} (“Altveen,” “we,” “us”) for software
          development, design, or digital marketing services. By using our site
          or services, you agree to these Terms.
        </LegalIntro>

        <h2>Services</h2>
        <p>
          Altveen provides custom software development (web and mobile
          applications, APIs, integrations), website design and development
          (including Shopify, WordPress, Webflow), digital marketing (SEO,
          content, social media, paid ads, analytics), and related consulting.
          The specific scope, deliverables, timelines, and fees for any project
          will be set out in a separate proposal, statement of work, or contract
          (“Project Agreement”). In case of conflict between these Terms and a
          Project Agreement, the Project Agreement prevails for that project.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Obligations</h2>
        <p>
          You agree to provide accurate information, timely feedback, content,
          and access (e.g. to accounts, APIs, or brand assets) as reasonably
          required for us to perform the services. You are responsible for
          ensuring you have the rights to any materials you provide. Delays in
          providing inputs may affect timelines and we are not liable for such
          delays.
        </p>

        <h2>Fees and Payment</h2>
        <p>
          Fees and payment terms will be specified in the Project Agreement.
          Unless otherwise agreed, we may require a deposit or milestone
          payments. Invoices are typically due within the period stated on the
          invoice (e.g. 15 or 30 days). We reserve the right to suspend work or
          withhold deliverables if payment is overdue.
        </p>

        <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          Unless otherwise agreed in writing, upon full payment for the work,
          ownership of custom deliverables (e.g. code, designs, copy created
          specifically for you) transfers to you. We retain rights to our
          pre-existing tools, frameworks, and know-how. Third-party assets (e.g.
          stock images, fonts) may be subject to their own licences. For ongoing
          marketing or hosting, licence terms will be set out in the Project
          Agreement.
        </p>

        <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
        <p>
          Each party agrees to keep confidential the other’s confidential
          information and not to disclose it except as needed to perform the
          services or as required by law. We will not use your confidential
          information for our own benefit beyond delivering your project.
        </p>

        <h2>Warranties and Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          We warrant that we will perform the services with reasonable skill and
          care. Except as expressly set out in the Project Agreement, we do not
          guarantee specific business results (e.g. rankings, revenue). To the
          fullest extent permitted by law, our liability is limited to the fees
          paid for the relevant project in the twelve months preceding the
          claim. We are not liable for indirect, consequential, or punitive
          damages.
        </p>

        <h2>Termination</h2>
        <p>
          Either party may terminate a project in accordance with the Project
          Agreement. On termination, you pay for work completed and any
          non-cancellable costs we have incurred. We will hand over completed
          deliverables as agreed.
        </p>

        <h2>General</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms are governed by the laws of India. Any disputes are
          subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Jammu &amp;
          Kashmir. If any provision is held invalid, the rest remains in effect.
          Our failure to enforce a right does not waive it.
