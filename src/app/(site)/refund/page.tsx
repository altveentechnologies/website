      <LegalBody>
        <LegalIntro>
          {SITE.legalName} (“Altveen”) provides software development, design,
          and digital marketing services. This policy explains when and how
          refunds or adjustments may apply. Specific terms for your project may
          also be set out in your proposal or contract.
        </LegalIntro>

        <h2>Consultation and Quotes</h2>
        <p>
          Initial consultations and written quotes are free. There is no charge
          or refund applicable for deciding not to proceed after a consultation
          or quote.
        </p>

        <h2>Project Deposits and Milestone Payments</h2>
        <p>
          For fixed-scope projects, we often request a deposit or
          milestone-based payments. Once work has started in line with the
          agreed scope, deposits and milestone payments are generally
          non-refundable, as they cover time and resources already spent. If you
          cancel the project before agreed deliverables are completed, we will
          discuss a fair settlement, for example, refunding any portion of fees
          that has not yet been applied to work done or committed costs.
        </p>

        <h2>Retainers and Ongoing Services</h2>
        <p>
          For monthly retainers (e.g. digital marketing, maintenance, or
          support), payment is typically for the current month. If you wish to
          cancel, we ask for notice as per your agreement (e.g. 30 days). No
          refund is usually given for the current month once services have been
          rendered; unused prepaid periods may be prorated or credited where
          applicable and agreed in writing.
        </p>

        <h2>Subscriptions and Third-Party Costs</h2>
        <p>
          Costs we incur on your behalf (e.g. hosting, software licences, ad
          spend) are often non-refundable once paid to third parties. We will
          clarify which costs are recoverable when we set up the engagement.
        </p>

        <h2>Disputes and Quality Issues</h2>
        <p>
          If you are not satisfied with our work, please contact us at{" "}
          <a href={`mailto:${SITE.email}`}>{SITE.email}</a>. We will work with
          you in good faith to resolve the issue, for example by correcting or
          redoing work that does not meet the agreed scope or quality. Refunds
          or credits may be considered on a case-by-case basis where we have not
          been able to fulfil our agreed obligations.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Request a Refund or Adjustment</h2>
        <p>
          Send a clear description of your request and your project or invoice
          reference to <a href={`mailto:${SITE.email}`}>{SITE.email}</a>. We
          will respond within a reasonable time (typically within 5–10 business
          days) and, where applicable, process approved refunds via the original
          payment method or as otherwise agreed.
        </p>
