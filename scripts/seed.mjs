    content: `<p>Choosing between custom software and off-the-shelf products depends on your business needs, budget, and long-term goals. Off-the-shelf solutions work well for common workflows, but they often come with limitations and recurring licensing costs.</p>
<p>Custom software is built around your exact processes, integrates with your existing systems, and scales with you. It requires a higher initial investment but often pays off in efficiency and competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Consider your roadmap: if you need unique workflows, deep integrations with CRMs or e-commerce, or a product that becomes a differentiator, custom development is usually the right path. For standard CRM, accounting, or collaboration, a well-chosen SaaS product may be enough.</p>
<p>Our team helps you evaluate both options and build custom solutions when they deliver clear value - so you invest wisely.</p>`,
